# Progress: `CheckpointsService` Verification & Next Steps

## 1. What Works
*   **gRPC Server Startup in Docker:** The Cline extension's gRPC server now starts reliably within the Dockerized OpenVSCode Server environment.
*   **Core gRPC Functionality:**
    *   `UpdateSettings` RPC.
    *   `StartTask` RPC, including streaming of `TASK_STARTED`, `STATE`, and `PARTIAL_MESSAGE` (including `SAY_COMPLETION_RESULT`).
    *   `sendUserInput` RPC.
    *   `SubmitAskResponse` RPC.
    *   `McpService` RPCs (`toggleMcpServer`, `updateMcpTimeout`, `addRemoteMcpServer`): All E2E tested and working.
*   **`CheckpointsService` (`checkpointDiff`, `checkpointRestore` RPCs):** Verified implementation and integration with core checkpoint logic as per `proto/checkpoints.proto` definition.
*   **Task Handoff Mechanism:**
    *   `ResumeLatestTask` RPC added to `proto/task_control.proto`.
    *   `Controller` updated with `resumeLatestTaskFromHistory()` method.
    *   `GrpcBridge` updated to handle `ResumeLatestTask` RPC.
    *   Go client updated to call `ResumeLatestTask`.
    *   Import paths for `TelemetryService` and `FeatureFlagsService` in `src/core/task/index.ts` corrected.
    *   Build verified with `npm run compile`.
*   **gRPC Passive Observation Mode (2025-05-22):**
    *   Implemented logic in `GrpcBridge.ts` to handle scenarios where Cline is user-controlled (no active gRPC `clientId` managing tasks).
    *   Enhanced logging for gRPC calls received without an active, mapped task.
    *   Modified `handleDeleteTaskWithId` to prevent gRPC clients from deleting tasks they don't "own" (i.e., not in `clientTaskMap`).
    *   Added `getTaskHistory()` to `Controller.ts` to support task existence checks in `GrpcBridge.ts`.
*   **Proto Generation & Basic Server Setup:** `npm run protos` (with `outputServices=grpc-js`), gRPC server (`server.ts`) setup, service registration, and `GrpcBridge.ts` structure are stable.
*   **Go Client (`sandbox-client`):** Connects to the gRPC server, makes calls, and receives streamed responses correctly. E2E tests cover multiple services, including a basic test for `ResumeLatestTask`.
*   **Testing Infrastructure & Logging:**
    *   **`scripts/update-sandbox-vsix.sh`**: Reliably packages the extension for Docker testing.
    *   **`scripts/run-sandbox-docker.sh`**: Orchestrates Docker builds and runs with robust log handling.
    *   **`sandbox-client/entrypoint.sh`**: Correctly configures log paths.
    *   Primary logs for analysis are individual files in `run_logs/`.
*   **Build System:** `npm run compile` (TypeScript, ESLint, esbuild) is clean.

## 2. What's Left (Prioritized)
1.  **(Implementation) Expand Service Coverage:** Determine the next gRPC service to implement or if existing services like `CheckpointsService` need expansion (which would require proto updates first).
2.  **(Refinement) gRPC Error Handling & Lifecycle (Ongoing):** Continue to monitor and refine as more services are implemented.
3.  **(Verification) Comprehensive Type Mapping:** Verify all type mappings in `src/services/grpc/mapper.ts` beyond currently active RPCs.
4.  **(Housekeeping) Address Linting Warnings:** Address any minor linting warnings in the codebase when convenient.

## 3. Current Status
*   **gRPC Server in Docker:** Stable and operational.
*   **Build & Test Workflow:** Robust and E2E tests are passing for implemented services.
*   **Key RPCs Implemented & Verified:** `UpdateSettings`, `StartTask`, `sendUserInput`, `SubmitAskResponse`, all `McpService` RPCs, `ResumeLatestTask`.
*   **`CheckpointsService` (`checkpointDiff`, `checkpointRestore`):** Verified as implemented and integrated according to `proto/checkpoints.proto`.
*   **Task Handoff:** Core components implemented. Relies on standard task state saving and gRPC call to resume.
*   **gRPC Passive Observation Mode (2025-05-22):** Implemented. The gRPC server now behaves more defensively when Cline is user-controlled, logging unexpected calls and preventing unauthorized actions on tasks. `GrpcBridge.ts` and `Controller.ts` were updated.
*   **gRPC Message Handling:**
    *   De-duplication logic for text-based streams in `GrpcBridge.ts` is verified.
    *   **E2E Test Hang Fix (2025-05-22):** Modified `src/core/task/index.ts` to ensure `ASK TOOL` messages are sent with `partial: false`. This is intended to resolve the hang in the "calculator app" stage of the E2E test. Verification pending.
*   **E2E Test Resource Cleanup (2025-05-22):**
    *   **Go Client:** `CancelTask` gRPC call added via `defer` for Phase 1.
    *   **Puppeteer Script:** Verified existing `browser.close()` in `shutdown` is sufficient.
    *   **Entrypoint Script:** Verified existing OpenVSCode Server termination in `cleanup` is sufficient.
*   **Build Health:** `npm run compile` is clean. All previous TypeScript, ESLint, and build script errors (e.g., `esbuild.js` SyntaxError, `ts-proto` `Buffer` issues, webview `EmptyRequest.create()` errors) are resolved.

## 4. Known Issues / Blockers
*   **E2E Test Hang (Calculator App Stage):** Potentially resolved by the fix in `src/core/task/index.ts` (2025-05-22). Awaiting verification.
*   **E2E Test gRPC Server Binding Error (Phase 2):** Persistent "No address added out of total X resolved" error. The resource cleanup implemented in this task aims to resolve this. Awaiting verification.
*   **E2E Test Webview Module Resolution Error:** Intermittent "Failed to resolve module specifier \"@grpc/grpc-js\"". The resource cleanup might also help here. Awaiting verification.
*   **Next Major Phase:**
    *   **(Testing)** Verify the E2E test hang fix and resource cleanup effectiveness by running `bash scripts/run-sandbox-docker.sh` and analyzing logs.
    *   **(Testing)** Verify the new gRPC Passive Observation Mode behavior.
    *   **(Testing)** Conduct thorough E2E testing of the task handoff mechanism using the Dockerized environment once the above issues are resolved.
    *   Decision on the next gRPC service for implementation or expansion of existing services.
    *   Comprehensive verification of all type mappings in `mapper.ts`.
    *   Address minor linting warnings.
