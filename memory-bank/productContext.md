# Product Context: Cline gRPC Integration (Summary)

## 1. Problem Solved
Addresses challenges of running AI agents in local VSCode for managed platforms by enabling:
*   **Isolation:** Prevents agent impact on host/other users.
*   **Resource Management:** Controls agent computational use.
*   **Centralized Control:** Backend management of multiple agent lifecycles.
*   **Scalability:** Independent scaling of agent deployment.

## 2. How It Should Work
A central backend (via gRPC) should be able to:
1.  **Spawn:** Create new Cline instances in isolated environments (e.g., Docker).
2.  **Initiate:** Start tasks with initial prompts.
3.  **Interact:** Relay I/O (user inputs, agent questions, tool results).
4.  **Monitor:** Receive all agent output (text, tool calls, status).
5.  **Terminate:** Stop agent instances and environments.

## 3. User Experience Goals
*   **Seamlessness:** User interaction should feel like direct Cline use.
*   **Reliability:** Robust gRPC communication and sandboxing.
*   **Security:** Effective agent execution isolation.
